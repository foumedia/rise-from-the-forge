  <h2>Bounties</h2>
  <h2>JUSTICE ISN’T FREE. NAME YOUR TARGET.</h2>
  <p>
    Maybe they wronged you. Took your pack, your trade, your last good day.
    Doesn’t matter now. Call in a few favors — the Wasteland settles scores its
    own way.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Post their name. Their crew.</strong> Let folks across the Pitt know
    someone’s got it coming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If they fall?</strong> Bounties make things messy. And if they’re
    taken alive? Don’t count on seeing ‘em again.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The bigger the bounty,</strong> the quicker the hounds come
    sniffin’.
