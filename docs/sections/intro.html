  Congratulations on surviving the post-apocalypse <em>and</em> making a
  fantastic choice to participate in <strong>Rise from the Forge</strong> — a
  <strong>Fallout: Factions</strong> skirmish Core Rulebook Campaign.

<p>
  Set in The Pitt, a fractured region once ruled by steel, circuitry, and civic
  pride, and now occupied by Super Mutant warbands, Raider clans, Brotherhood of
  Steel patrols, Surface Dwellers, cultists, and other unregistered entities
  compete for control of the technologies of yesterday... and the future of
  tomorrow.
