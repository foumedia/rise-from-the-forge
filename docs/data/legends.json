Once a Vault dweller before being kidnapped by the Master, she was dunked into a vat of Forced Evolutionary Virus and emerged as an assassin for the forces gathering around Mariposa Military Base. When the Master’s forces were disbanded, she headed off towards the Mojave. Lily is now a Jacobstown resident, a safe haven for mutantkind.",
