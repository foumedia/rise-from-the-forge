    "title": "WASTELAND OBJECTIVE - 11: GOLIATH LURKS",
    "Exclusive Objective": "If a game already has an Exclusive Objective, a second one cannot be chosen.",
    "Deployment Pool": "Add an Objective Marker to the Deployment Pool.",
    "Special Rule": "If an odd number of three players are present, you may run this Objective. When Getting Started, do the following: Instead of rolling on the table for Raid or Wasteland, choose the Wasteland location. Choose a Player to run the Goliath. Add this Objective to the Scenario automatically, it is an Exclusive Objective. The two regular players roll an Objective, as usual, however the player with the most Scout Points, or spends the most Scout Points, or — in the event of a tie — who wins a roll-off chooses ONE Objective from the two dice results to apply to the Scenario. Players may choose to roll for a Hazard, or not. All Hazard Special Rules do not affect or target the Goliath crew.\n\nAt the start of the Game, the Goliath player deploys a Goliath from the Spooktober Packet instead of a regular crew. The two regular players get the Special Ploy: ['Something Made It Mad!': Either player may enact this Ploy at the start of their Turn. Remove all Fatigue from an Exhausted Goliath.]. After each players Turn, the Goliath may choose to take a Turn, if they are able to for any reason (such as playing a Second Wind Ploy). The Goliath gets 3 Ploys that they may use ONLY on the 3 Standard Ploys. The Goliath is deployed in contact with the Objective Marker closest to the center of the Map, unless a rule says otherwise.\n\n (The Monstrous Injury Table has been modified to cause Injuries on Equal to or Greater than Endurance. Optional Homebrew Entourage perks are now on all the Goliaths - same as the Wendigo - for optional Grunts to give the Goliath player more opportunities to take Turns during a game. This increases the difficulty - proceed with caution!).\n\nLink to <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FJgHj_VeaqqcGOj0om7oYqv-dR-vOpwcHlyiAwOXUnk/edit?usp=sharing' target='blank'>'Goliath Lurks' Minigame Sheets unique to each Goliath </a>",
    "Story Outcome": "A Crew Scores points on the Goliath's Minigame sheet Scoreboard as follows: \nA)  Score 1 Point: Each 'Harm' token a Crew Attack generates (Excess Harm does NOT score!)\n B) Score 2 Points: Each 'Injury' marked on the Goliath sheet caused by a Crew Attack\nC) Score 1 point: When a player plays the 'Something Made it Mad' ploy.\n The Crew that scored the most Points gains 3 Reach.\n\nOnly if the Goliath is Incapacitated at Stage B then, at the End of the Game, the Crew that Incapacitated the Goliath chooses a Friendly model remaining in play to perform 2 Rummage Actions for 'looting the Goliath'. If no Friendly models remain at the End of the Game (i.e. Retreating), the opposing Crew receives this reward instead.\n\nIf the Player who deployed the Goliath has an Active Crew in the campaign, they may choose to gain 3XP for their crew OR an additional Story Action they may use immediately before their next Game."

    "description": "A massive cache of pre-War Nuka-Cola surfaces — unfortunately right in Liberty Prime’s weapons testing ground. Up to Eight wasteland crews race to haul the crate off the field before Prime’s bombardment turns them to glowing vapor.",
    "Deployment Pool": "1 Objective Token - Nuka-Cola Crate \n8 Search Tokens\n4 Round Tokens",
    "Starting Positions": "Setup a table with 3' x 3' map, and mark the center of each of the nine (9) 1'x'1 squares that comprise that map. Attached to one side, add an extra 2' of sidecar map to deploy Liberty Prime. Crews can not enter the Sidecar Map.\n\n Each player may bring up to 200 points of models, with a maximum of 6 models per Crew from their Crew Roster. At least one model must be a Champion. Any unselected models are 'Sitting Out'. Each Crew receives 100 caps to spend on a single Legend of the Wasteland, and/or Chems and Ploys. If a Crew spends fewer than 200 points on roster models, the leftover points are added to their 100-cap Advantage Pool. Legends of the Wasteland models will skip the Aftermath Table step for this scenario.\n\nAt game start, each player randomly draws an Initiative Token (#1–#8). Players then choose their deployment zone in initiative order (lowest number first). Each player deploys in a corner or middle-edge (not facing the Side Car), in a 6\" wide column originating at the center of the deployment zone, but beyond 20″ from the center of the table. Liberty Prime begins 24″ at the furthest middle-edge of the Sidecar Map, facing straight toward the Nuka-Cola Crate. As each round progresses, the first player to finish all activations receives token #1 for the next round, the second receives #2, and so on to determine Initiative order.\n\nCrews receive Ploys as normal. Scout Points may be used for a Reposition at setup, as per the normal rules.",
    "Special Rules": "LIBERTY PRIME ACTIVATION — At the start of each Round, Liberty Prime performs the Nuclear Football Targeting Phase: Randomly select the center of one of the marked square zones and mark it with a Nuclear Football marker. When randomly selecting, eligible Squares must be Occupied by a Crew, did NOT resolve Nuclear Football attack last round and does NOT Contain the Nuka Cola Crate. Mark that square zone, place a Nuclear Football Marker on top of any Terrain at the Center of the Square.\n\nAfter all Crews can not take any more activations, Before the end of Each Round – Liberty Prime Resolves the following:\n A) Nuclear Football Impact. An Area(12\"Square) attack is resolved on the center of the square with the Nuclear Football Marker. All models with any part of their base touching the marked square resolve Damage, drawing Line of Sight from 3\" over where the Nuclear Football Marker is):\n • Wide Open → 2 Injuries + maximum Harm.\n • Visible but not Wide Open → 1 Injury + maximum Harm.\n • Not Visible → maximum Harm.\n • For the next Round, that entire square zone is treated as Radioactive, place a Radioactive or custom Marker in the Center of the Square. Remove this marker the end of the next Round.\n After the attack is resolved, remove any terrain within 3\" of the Center of the Square.\n\nB) Laser Sweep: Fires an Area(12\"Square) centered on three different randomly chosen Crew Occupied square zones. All models within that Square are Targeted, and resolve the following Damage. Resolve Line of Sight and Visibility from the Liberty Prime model, per normal rules.\n • Wide Open → 1 Injury + maximum Harm.\n • Visible but not Wide Open → maximum Harm.\n • Not Visible → no effect.\n\n  C) Advance & Stomp: Advances 12″ straight toward the Crate. If within 6″ of any models, resolve Stomp:\n • Within 1″ → 1 Injury + 2 Harm + Fatigue.\n • Within 3″ → 2 Harm + Fatigue.\n • Within 6″ → Fatigue.\n D) Reset: Remove all Harm from Liberty Prime at the Start of the Next Round.\n\nTHE CRATE ESCAPE — If a model is in Proximity of the Nuka Cola Crate they may place the Nuka Cola Crate in Base contact with that model after performing a Get Moving action. If only one model is in Proximity of the Nuka Cola Crate, it may move up to 4″, if 2 models in Proximity use Movement Orders they may move up to 8″. Models within Proximity of the Crate cannot perform Open Fire. If models from Opposing crews are in Proximity of the Crate, they count as Engaged with the Crate. If a model performs a Back Off action; choose a model from each Crews engaged with the Crate to roll a  4S, and the Crew with the most Hits immediately places the Crate outside of Proximity of the other models, the model which Backed Off may then complete its 2\" movement. When moved, place the Crate anywhere touching the mover’s base.\n\nSEARCH TOKENS — Eight Search tokens are placed by the Organizer, (Optional: Place a Physical Nuka-Cola Cap on top). Tokens must be positioned in line with each of the eight deployment zones and the center, in some fashion, ensuring roughly even access for all players. When a player performs a Rummage action on a Search Token, in place of rolling the two standard dice, set both results to 10 and 10 and can not be re-rolled, otherwise resolve the Rummage Action per normal rules. (Optional: the player also gains 1 physical Nuka-Cola cap.)",
    "Story Outcome": "When the Nuka-Cola Crate touches a board edge, remove the Objective Token and give it to the Crew that grabbed the crate. The game ends at the end of that round. The player or crew that moved the Crate into contact with the board edge is declared the winner.\n\nAt the End of Round 4:\n• If one or more crews have a model within 1″ of the Crate, the crew with the most models within 1″ wins.\n• If no models are within 1″, the crew with the single model closest to the Crate wins.\n• If still tied, roll off.\n\nLegends of the Wasteland skip any Aftermath steps. Nuked: Any Champion directly elimated by a Liberty Prime weapon this game rolls on the Annihilation Table instead of the standard Aftermath table. If the Annihilation table mentions the 'Opposing player' the player deployed to the Right of that player is the Opposing player. All players gain 3 XP. During the next Story Phase, The winning crew receives 3 Nuka-Cola Chems, 3 Nuka-Cola Dark Rare Chems, 3 Nuka-Cola Quantum Homebrew Rare Chems (rules below), and any special prizes of the Organizers choice!",

All other Liberty Prime actions and attacks resolve as normal.
