    "description": "A massive, mutated creature that lurks in the wasteland, challenging crews to prove their strength and cunning.",
    "title": "WASTELAND OBJECTIVE - 11: GOLIATH LURKS",
    "Exclusive Objective": "If a game already has an Exclusive Objective, a second one cannot be chosen.",
    "Deployment Pool": "Add an Objective Marker to the Deployment Pool.",
    "Special Rule": "If you have an odd number of players to play with, Instead of rolling on the tables for a Scenario, choose the Wasteland location. Players may roll for a Hazard if they choose. All Hazard Special Rules do not affect or target the Goliath crew. The first player that would roll on the Objectives chooses this Objective. The second player rolls an Objective as usual, treating this Objective as an Exclusive Objective.\n\nAt the start of the Game, one of the three players deploys a Goliath from the Spooktober Packet instead of a regular crew. Include the Goliath Special Ploy: 'Something Made It Mad!': [Either player may enact this Ploy at the start of their Turn. Remove all Fatigue from an Exhausted Goliath.] for both regular crews. After each players Turn, the Goliath may choose to take a Turn, if they are able to for any reason. The Goliath gets 3 Ploys that they may use ONLY on the 3 Standard Ploys. The Goliath is deployed in contact with the Objective Marker closest to the center of the Map.",
    "Story Outcome": "Crews Score points on the Goliath's Minigame sheet as follows: \nA)  Score 1 Point: For each 'Harm' result that a Friendly attack applies to the Goliath (Excess Harm does NOT score!)\n B) Score 2 Points:  For each 'Injury and Harm' result that a Friendly attack applies to the Goliath.\nC) Score 1 point: When a player plays the 'Something Made it Mad' ploy.\n The Crew that scored the most Points gains 3 Reach.\n\nOnly if the Goliath is Incapacitated at Stage B then, at the End of the Game, the Crew that Incapacitated the Goliath chooses a Friendly model remaining in play to perform 2 Rummage Actions for 'looting the Goliath'. If no Friendly models remain at the End of the Game (i.e. Retreating), the opposing Crew receives this reward instead.\n\nIf the Player who deployed the Goliath has an Active Crew in the campaign, they gain 3XP for their crew."
