    "Special Rule": "If you have an odd number of players to play with, Instead of rolling on the tables for a Scenario, choose the Wasteland and the first player that would roll on the Objectives chooses this Objective . The second player rolls an Objective as usual, treating this Objective as an Exclusive Objective.\n\nAt the start of the Game, one of the three players deploys a Goliath from the Spooktober Packet instead of a regular crew. Include the Goliath Ploy for both regular crews. The Goliath gets 3 Ploys that they may use ONLY on the 3 Standard Ploys. The Goliath is deployed in contact with the Objective Marker closest to the center of the Map.",
    "Story Outcome": "When a Crew Injures the Goliath, score 1 point for that Crew on the Goliath's Crew sheet. The Crew that scored the most Injuries gains 2 Reach.\n\nThe crew that lands the final Injury to incapacitate the Goliath at Stage B chooses a remaining Friendly model  to perform 2 Rummage Actions at the end of the Game.\n\nIf the Player who deployed the Goliath has a crew in the campaign, they gain 1XP for their crew."
