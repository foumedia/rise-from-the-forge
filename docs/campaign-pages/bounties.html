  <p>
    Maybe they wronged you. Took your pack, your trade, your last good day.
    Doesn’t matter now. Call in a few favors — the Wasteland settles scores its
    own way.

    <strong>Post their name. Their crew.</strong> Let folks across the Pitt know
    someone’s got it coming.
    <br />
    <strong>If they fall?</strong> Bounties help get the job done. And if
    they’re taken alive? Don’t count on seeing ‘em again.
    <br />

    <strong>The bigger the bounty,</strong> the quicker the hounds come
    sniffin’.

  <h3>Justice isn’t free. Name your price.</h3>
