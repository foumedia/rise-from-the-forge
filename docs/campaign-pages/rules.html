    <div>Four Leaf Clover Limits</div>
    <div style="flex: 4">

      Training.

  <div class="green-table-row">
    <div>Area(X) Constraints</div>
    <div style="flex: 4">
      Area weapons will go through walls and create a vertical column of Area damage infinitely high. If their vertical
      reach or penetration seems unreasonable, this Rule permits the Defender to state which models they believe are out
      of reach of the Area attack before dice are rolled. The Attacker should adjust the attack accordingly or offer a
      counterargument. If
      unresolved, consult @Bastet, @DwillySkilly, or another player for a final ruling. If doubt remains, follow the
      rules as written, even if unrealistic.
